Strimzi Operators are fundamental to the project. These Operators are purpose-built with specialist operational knowledge to effectively manage Kafka. 
Operators simplify the process of: Deploying and running Kafka clusters and components, Configuring and securing access to Kafka, Upgrading and managing 
Kafka and even taking care of managing topics and users.


Provides
	Docker Images for running Apache Kafka and Zookeeper
	Templates for deploying Apache Kafka on Kubernetes/openshift
	Tooling for managing and configuring Apache kafka clusters
	
Cluster Controller - Creating and managing Apache Kafka clusters
	User creates a config map for describing a cluster
	Watches the config maps and creates apache zookeeper and apache kafka cluster
	changes in config maps are applied to the clusters as well
	deploys additional components such as topiccontroller

Topic Controller - Creating and managing Kafka Topics

Kubernetes provides
	Statefulsets for stable identity and network
	Together with headless services for internal network
	Services for accessing the cluster
	Secrets and Config Maps for handling configurations
	Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim for durable storage
	
		

Initial Deployments
Updates on Kafka/Zookeeper Cluster
Operator pattern is the best way to run stateful services with complex operational needs
Managing kafka resources like brokers, zookeepers, topics, users and mirror maker configurations using Kubernetes custom resources
using transient and persistent volume storage options
operational tasks - rolling cluster updates, upgrading scaling broker, moving broker, monitoring, running multiple kafka cluster on the same kubernetes cluster

Initial Deployment
Managing Zookeeper
Replacing Brokers
Topic partition rebalancing - reallocating partitions across brokers
Decommisioning or adding brokers

Stateful workloads - Databases of Kafka
Cluster resource mananger use Linux containers and provide isolation
cgroups constrain resources
Namespaces isolate file system/process trees
Docker is just a project to describe and share containers efficiently(others: Rocket, Mesos, LXC(Linux containers))
Containers are available for several platforms

User Space - Container, Container Engine, Cluster Resource Manager
kernel Namespace - Namespaces, cgroups, modules, drivers (Linux Kernel)
Physical or Virtual Machine

Operator Pattern -	
	Controller/Operator (Strimzi operator written in Java)
		Active Reconcilaion Loop for {
			desired := getDesiredState()
			current := getCurrentState()
			makeChanges(desired,current)
		}

	Deploy reconcilation plan
	
Kubernetes have resources like pods, replica sets, signal sets, services
Extend Kubernetes using Custom Resource Definitions. Custom Resource Definition is used for configuring and run the Kafka cluster

Stateful services in Kubernetes
	Stable pod and network identity
	Stable persistent storage
	Ordered deployment and updates
	Ordered graceful deletion and termination
	Ordered automated rolling updates
	
	-statefulSet = Pod(kafka-brokers-0) -> PersistentVolumeClaim(data-kafka-brokers-0)
	-statefulSet is basically a container around group of (stateful)pods like databases, kafka
	-Dynamic provisioning enabled in your Kubernetes cluster. 
	-PersistentVolumeClaim abstracts the storage. We need to declare what storage we want. Accordinly either a local storage or a distributed block storage solution(cluster/cloud/EBS) will be
	  assigned. It will eventually get balanced with persistent volume

STRIMZI
++++++++	  
Strimzi - Open source operator based Apache kafka project for Kubernetes and OpenShift
Cluster Operator watches Kafka(Configuration/Custom Resource) CRD. Deploys to Kafka(Broker Pod) StatefulSet and Zookeeper(Zookeeper Pod) StatefulSet. Entity Operators(User and Topic Operator)

Strimzi Storage Modes - 
	Ephemeral(Empty Dir Volume for Dev/test, spun up/destoryed automatically along with pod)
	Persistent - Ideal for Production
	Persistent JBOD	- Bunch of mount points to a bunch of persistent volumes
	
Connecting Clients
	simple-strimzi-kafka-bootstrap.strimzi.svc.cluster.local:9092
	simple-strimzi -> kafka resource metadata name
	kafka-bootstrap -> broker load balancer name
	strimzi -> Namespace
	svc - K8s service
	9092 -> Plain(TLS - 9093/ Interboker - 9094/ Prometheus- 9404)
	
Rolling Configuration Updates
	Process
	1.Watched Kafka Resource Change
	2.Apply new config to Kafka StatefulSet spec	
	3.Starting from Pod 0, delete the Pod and allow the stateful set to recreate it
	4.Kafka pod will generate new broker config
	5.Kafka is started
	6.Wait until the readiness check is good
	7.Repeat from step 3 for the next pod
	
Scaling brokers up
	increase replica count -> spec.kafka.replicas
	reassign partitions -> ./bin/kafka-reasign-partitions.sh
	
kubectl delete pod kafka-1

#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e

kubectl run -n strimzi --image strimzi/kafka producer --command -- /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-producer-perf-test.sh \
--topic simple-topic \
--num-records 1000000 \
--record-size 100 \
--throughput 1000 \
--producer-props bootstrap.servers=simple-strimzi-kafka-bootstrap:9092
