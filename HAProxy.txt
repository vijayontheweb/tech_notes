HAProxy Architecture
Frontend - Anything in front of HAProxy
	Timeou Client
	Bind	(which port?)
	ACL
Backend - Anything behind HAProxy
	Timeout Connect
	Timeout Server
	Balance(roundrobin, leastconn, source)
Multiple Frontends or Multiple Backends
Frontend binds to one or more ports
A Frontend connects to a backend
E.g. Two frontends	
	Frontend-http - binds 80(forwards to https backend)
	Frontend-https - binds 443

HAProxy Modes - TCP and HTTP
	Frontend and backend can have mode of protocol
	Which layer they work on Layer 4(TCP) Layer 7(http)
	Using mode tcp becomes layer 4 proxy	(SSL Passhrough. Just Load balance)
	Using mode http becomes layer 7 proxy    (SSL Terminate. Can look through data)

ACL(Access Control List)
	Conditionals applied to route traffic
	Applies on both frontend and backend
	Ex. block any request to /admin(needs http mode)
	Reroute traffic to different backend microservices
	ACL can also be applied to layer4 in addition to layer7

TLS termination vs TLS Passthrough
	Frontend is TLS(https) backend is not(http)
	HAProxy terminates TLS, decrypts and send encrypted
	Can look at the data, L7 ACL(can play with data), re-write headers,cache but requires cert

TLS Passthrough
	Backend is TLS
	Haproxy frontends proxy directly to the backend
	No Caching, L4 ACL only(can play with ip alone, not data), but more secure, haproxy doesn't need cert
	
Demo
	Install HAProxy
	Simple Frontend :80 backend with many servers loadbalance
	ACL
		Conditional app1 app2
		prevent admin access
	Enable HTTPS on HAProxy
	Enable HTTP/2 on HAProxy
	
sudo yum install haproxy
