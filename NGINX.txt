##### APACHE vs NGINX #####
Apache is prefork(receive request upto preconfigured number and reject the rest) whereas Nginx deals with request aysnchronously
NGINX serves faster static resources and handles higher concurrency(receives 1000s of request on a single processing thread) as compared to Apache

#### INSTALL NGINX #####
2 OPTIONS 1.Using Package Manager 2.Build from Source code

Using Package Manager
	yum check-update
	yum install epel-release
	yum install nginx (by default yum doesn't come preinstalled with NGINX)
	NGINX installation path -> ls -l /etc/nginx
	service nginx start -> Redirects to /bin/systemctl start nginx.service
